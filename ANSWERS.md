3. What were the most challenging parts: Not Really
4. Any additional comments about the task/implementation: Did it in a very basic manner.
5. If you had more time to complete the test, are there any particular changes/refactoring that you would have liked to do: Yes definitely would like to implement the different desing patterns into it and implement tests also. Would like to implement the same functionalities using Kotlin, but right now kotlin is pretty new for me and im learning it, but would like to use it for sure.
There might be some issues in the code as i am still brain storming it also working on test cases.
